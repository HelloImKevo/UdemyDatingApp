# UdemyDatingApp
Udemy course Dating App built with ASPNET Core and Angular infrastructure.


# Dependencies
Download and install .NET:  
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

If you are using Mac Apple Silicon Chip, install
.NET 6.0 for Arm64.

Download and install Node JS:  
https://nodejs.org/en/

You can use version 18.15.0 LTS  

Configure your Git Access. I recommend using Git Credential Manager Core:
https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/blob/release/docs/install.md

Run:
```shell
git credential-manager configure

git config --show-origin --get credential.helper
```

You can erase existing OSX Keychain credentials with:
```shell
git config --unset credential.helper

git credential-osxkeychain erase

[Press Return]
```

See: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/updating-credentials-from-the-macos-keychain

If you're running into issues, make sure you aren't using a repo that was originally 
configured for SSH, and you are now attempting to use the same repo with Git 
Credential Manager - this will be significantly more complex to configure.


## A Walking Skeleton
A Walking Skeleton is a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small 
end-to-end function. It need not use the final architecture, but it should link 
together the main architectural components.

The architecture and the functionality can then evolve in parallel.

- Alistair Cockburn

LEARNING GOALS
Implement the basic API functionality and have an introductory understanding of:

1. Using the dotnet CLI
2. API Controllers and Endpoints
3. Entity Framework
4. The API Project structure
5. Configuration and Environment variables
6. Source control

## Creating a New Project
Run:
```shell
dotnet --info

dotnet -h
```

Create new solution file and project file:
```shell
dotnet new sln

dotnet new webapi -n API

ls

dotnet sln -h

dotnet sln add API/

dotnet sln list
```

Open Visual Studio Code, do "Show All Commands" (SHIFT + CMD + P), type "PATH", 
select option: **Shell command: Install 'code' command in PATH.**

If you run into a "Permission Denied" error, try uninstalling it first.

Open project by running this in the Terminal:
```shell
code .
```

## Visual Studio Code Setup

Go to the Extensions tab (looks like 4 Tetris blocks), and search for "C#".

Install the **C# Extension** verified by Microsoft (powered by OmniSharp); you don't
need to install any "Recommended Extensions" right now.

It's recommended to turn on Auto Save functionality, under File menu (click 
on "Auto Save").

With the same C# Extension still visible, Right click on the Extension and click on 
"Extension Settings". It might say "No Settings Found" -- no worries. Open the 
**Command Palette** (SHIFT + CMD + P), and search for "Reload" and click on the 
"Reload Window" option.

Under the Extension Settings, scroll down (while on the "User" tab) and find these
settings:
1. Omnisharp: Enable Async Completion (EXPERIMENTAL)
2. Omnisharp: Enable Import Completion
3. Omnisharp: Organize Imports On Format

Click the checkboxes to enable all of these settings. You should get a Visual Studio
Code notification prompting you to **Restart OmniSharp**, go ahead and accept that to
restart the Extension.

You can "Toggle Terminal" with CTRL + Backtick (aka, Grave Accent; the key to the 
left of the "1" on your keyboard numbers row).

Back in the Extensions area, search for **C# Extensions**, and install the Extension 
maintained by **JosKreativ**. And, install **Material Icon Theme** by Philipp Kief (after) 
this is installed, you need to click on "Material Icon Theme" in the Command Palette 
area (it should automagically show up). You might need to click on **Set File Icon Theme**,
depending on your operating environment.

Optionally: Under Preferences > Settings, search for "compact", and turn off
"Explorer: Compact Folders".

Open the **Command Palette** (SHIFT + CMD + P) and type ".net", and click on:
".NET: Generate Assets for Build and Debug". This will create the `.vscode` directory
and the configuration files: `launch.json` and `tasks.json`.

## Running Project for the First Time
Toggle the **Terminal** (CTRL + Backtick), change directory to `API/` and then run:
```shell
dotnet run
```

On MacOS, you will probably be prompted with a Keychain request and will require your
password. Here's the output from the Terminal for reference:
```
Building...
warn: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServer[5]
      The application is trying to access the ASP.NET Core developer certificate key. 
      A prompt might appear to ask for permission to access the key. When that happens, 
      select 'Always Allow' to grant 'dotnet' access to the certificate key in the future.
```

If you try to open the URL specified in your `Properties/launchSettings.json` file, like
https://localhost:7183/ -- you're not gonna see anything interesting right now, since our
"API" controller doesn't have any associated UI and it's just listening for API endpoints; 
you'll see something like this in your Browser:
```
This localhost page canâ€™t be found
No webpage was found for the web address: https://localhost:7183/
HTTP ERROR 404
```

Examine the `WeatherForecastController.cs` (after modifications to the codebase, this file 
will no longer exist), and look at the `[Route]` property -- the String, `"Controller"` gets
removed from the class name, to build the URL for the endpoint. So the active URL for the
project at this point in time is actually:  

https://localhost:5001/WeatherForecast  

When you view this URL, the browser should show the JSON contents of an
`IEnumerable<WeatherForecast>` like this:
```js
[{
    "date": "2023-03-16T17:54:14.96377-04:00",
    "temperatureC": 12,
    "temperatureF": 53,
    "summary": "Cool"
}, {
    "date": "2023-03-20T17:54:14.96394-04:00",
    "temperatureC": 39,
    "temperatureF": 102,
    "summary": "Chilly"
}]
```

Let's shut it down (CTRL + C) and then inspect the Help for dotnet: `dotnet run -h`.  

Based on the help docs, we can specify which launch profile we want to use, with a command
like: `dotnet run -lp "API"`. Note: You may run into a developer certificate issue, which
will be described in the **Terminal**; it should provide some suggested remediation steps, 
such as running `dotnet dev-certs https --clean`, which may require elevated privileges in
the Windows operating environment.  

In the `launchSettings.json` file, let's change the localhost ports within the `"applicationUrl"` 
element to 5001 and 5000, something like this:
```
"applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000"
```

Swagger won't be used for this project, so you can remove the `"launchUrl": "swagger"` entry. 
If you want to see a demonstration of it, you can add this property back, for reference:
```js
"profiles": {
  "API": {
    "commandName": "Project",
    "dotnetRunMessages": true,
    "launchBrowser": true,
    "launchUrl": "swagger",
    "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000",
    "environmentVariables": {
      "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
    }
  },
```

And then navigate to: https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html to see the automagically 
generated API documentation for the project. We're gonna be using a different tool to test 
our application.  

Inside our `API.csproj` file, it lists packages that we have installed. Let's get rid of
this `<ItemGroup>` element and its child entries, to simplify things:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore" Version="6.2.3" />
</ItemGroup>
```

After installing or uninstalling packages, you need to then run: `dotnet restore`. This
will result in some Project Errors we will fix now. Open `appsettings.Development.json` and
let's bump the AspNetCore level to `"Information"`:
```js
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

Open the `Program.cs` file, and clean up the services container to look like this:
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddControllers();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

Now let's run `dotnet watch run`. You should see a message like: `Hot reload enabled`. This feature 
to "Hot Reload" and re-deploy changes as you make them in the Editor can be finicky (sometimes it 
causes more problems than it solves).

### Further Visual Studio Code Enhancements

Open Settings, search for "exclude", under "Files: Exclude", click on **Add Pattern**. Type
`**/bin` and click **OK**. And do the same for `**/obj`. This will hide these folders from the
Solution Explorer, since we won't interact with them very often.

Open the **Keyboard Shortcuts** window under Settings, then click on the small icon in the
top-right corner with tooltip "Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)" (the icon looks like a piece
of paper with a folded corner, and a circular arrow on the left). In the `keybindings.json`
file, add this entry:

```json
{
    "key": "shift shift",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen"
}
```

Save the `keybindings.json` file and then close it. Now, when you double-tap SHIFT, it will open
up a sort of "Global Object Search" form field, and you can type the name of an entity, like
our `AppUser.cs`, and then press RETURN to open the file. Super-handy to have!
